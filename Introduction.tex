A robust sequence numbering method for T-cell receptors is important for all work with T-cell receptor sequence data. Universal numbering schemes and correct residue numbering is vital for sequence analysis and comparison. We present a numbering software for T-cell receptor sequences that will reliably implement a set of popular numbering schemes. The software also enables T-cell receptor sequences to be labeled using numbering schemes commonly used for antibodies, which will facilitate studying the differences and commonalities of T-cell receptors and antibodies. It will also enable antibody-based tools to be adapted to T-cell receptor sequences. The numbering software is made available at http://www.bioinf.org.uk/abs/
