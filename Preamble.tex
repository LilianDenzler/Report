The following report summarizes two projects: The T-Cell Receptor Numbering Project, as well as the Qualiloop project. 
In the first instance, a software package was created to reliably number T-Cell Receptor sequences. An accurate numbering package is essential for future proposed project within the PhD. The guiding idea for this section is to re-create a numbering system such as the in-house software used to number antibody sequences, applied to TCRs. 

Secondly, a 3D-model quality predictor of a Complementary Determining Rgion (CDR-H3) is presented. Machine learning techniques are implemented to predict the accuracy of CDR-H3 3D-models generated by antibody modelling software such as abYmod. The predictor is made available at \url{http://www.bioinf.org.uk/abs/qualiloop/}. 

Lastly, future directions for the PhD project are explored.

%I am hugely grateful to my primary supervisor Prof. Andrew Martin and chair of my committee for the invaluable patience %and feedback. I would also like to thank my secondary supervisor Prof. Adrian Shepherd and my tertiary supervisor Prof. %Benny Chain, who provided their expertise and guidance. Additionally, this endeavor would not have been possible without %the generous support from the MRC, who financed my research. Lastly, I would like to thank Immunocore, the iCASE %collaborating industrial partner.
