\section{Make Stability Predictions}
1. Make stability predictions
-  Retrain antibody Tm-predictor on TCRs
-  Use melting-point library at immunocore
-  Sequence vs. structure based predictions
\section{Make Modifications}
2. Make modifications
-  Analyse packing residues
-  Compare to antibody packing residues
-  Reengineer to stabilize

\section{TCR Modelling}
extract features or structural rules to aid modelling
Alphafold testing
-  Domain Packing Prediction
-  Affinity enhancement
-  Tool for flagging unusual patches on surface
-  Deamidation prediction
Prevent degradation, enhance stability

\subsection{Martin-like Numbering}
Own numbering scheme, based on Kabat but with insertions and deletions at the structurally correct positions (Martin numbering)
